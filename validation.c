/* This code is to find the error rates using validation.
   In validation we typically split our training data in two, train our model
   using one part, and evaluate the error rate using the other part.
   
   But here we already have validation sets apart from our training set.
   So we will be using that for evaluating our model's accuracy.
   ***************************************************

   Function validation evaluates the model accuracy, val is the file name of the validation set.
