Hierarchical Text Classification
=============================
This is our undergraduate final year project, Hierarchical Text Classification. The team members are 
Krishna Pingal B (me).
Bosco Frank Paul.
John C F.
Binu T Babu.

Our motivation for this came from lshtc(large scale hierarchical text classification) contests, so eventhough lshtc may require in-depth knowledge of various machine learning algorithms, optimizations and a lot of mathematics. We figured we would be able to do this by leaving large scale out of the equation, but at the same time still do the hierarchical text classification.
Hierarchical text classification when done properly would allow humans to navigate through tons of data (text files) withought us being overwhelmed.

We are basing our work on a paper An Optimized K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
