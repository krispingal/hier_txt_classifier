Hierarchical Text Classification
===============================
About
------------
This is our undergraduate final year project, Hierarchical Text Classification. The team members/contributors are 
*Krishna Pingal B (me)
*[Bosco Frank Paul] (https://github.com/boscofp)
*John C F and 
*Binu T Babu.


Our motivation for this came from lshtc(large scale hierarchical text classification) contests, so eventhough lshtc require in-depth knowledge of various machine learning algorithms, optimizations and a lot of mathematics. We figured we would be able to do Hierarchical Text Classification by leaving optimization and methods which are particularly targetting large input size.
Hierarchical text classification when done properly would allow humans to navigate through tons of data (text files) withought us being overwhelmed.

We are basing our work on a paper An Optimized K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
for Large Scale Hierarchical Text Classification:
