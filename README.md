Hierarchical Text Classification
===============================
About
------------
This is our undergraduate final year project, Hierarchical Text Classification. The team members/contributors are 
*  Krishna Pingal B (me)
*  [Bosco Frank Paul] (https://github.com/boscofp)
*  John C F and 
*  Binu T Babu.


Our motivation for this came from lshtc(large scale hierarchical text classification) contests, so eventhough lshtc require in-depth knowledge of various machine learning algorithms, optimizations and a lot of mathematics. We figured we would be able to do Hierarchical Text Classification by leaving optimization and methods which are particularly targetting large input size.
Hierarchical text classification when done properly would allow humans to navigate through tons of data (text files) withought us being overwhelmed.

We are basing our work on a paper An Optimized K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
for Large Scale Hierarchical Text Classification:

## GIT
The preferred way to contribute to this repository is to fork the repository

1. Fork the project reository: click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page. This creates a copy of the current image of the code under your account on the github server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:
   $ git clone https://github.com/krispingal/hier_txt_classifier

3. Create a branch to hold your changes:
   $ git checkout -b my-feature
   and start making changes. Never work in the *master* branch
